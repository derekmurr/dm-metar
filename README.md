# dm-metar-reports
### Tech test for Weever Apps
A METAR report is a loose international semi-standard used by airports for reporting information about wind speeds, humidity, and weather conditions. Weâ€™re going to write a program that parses a subset of these reports from a stream and keeps some running aggregates.

### Requirements
At minimum we require an interface that lets us:

- parse a METAR format record as described above
  - the returned data structure should normalize speeds to MPS
  - you can normalize a speed value in KT by dividing the value by 2
- Read a stream of records, one per line
  - and keep a running average wind speed per airport seen
  - and the current wind speed of each airport seen

Write a script to generate a few hundred thousand random reports one per line. Your program should be able to read the entire stream without failure and be able to either:

- display the running tally
- print a final report after reading the entire stream


### Assumptions:
- Report stream is a single string, inside which individual reports are separated by a newline
- Data within each report is space-delimited (there is one space between each data point, eg 'YYZ 122201Z 12023MPS')
- Each of the three data points (Airport code, timestamp, wind info) are always present
- Timestamp provides day of month, hours and minutes suffixed with a Z; for date parsing purposes, assume the Z indicates Zulu time (ie, GMT) and that all records in stream are for the same month

### Steps:
- Break report stream into an array of individual report strings
- For each report string:
  - Break report string into three on the space (Airport code, Timestamp, Wind info)
  - Parse string and build an object for each record:
    ```{ 
      icaoCode: airport code string
      timestampDay/Hour/Minute: parse timestamp string into integers for day, hour, minute, based on assumptions above
      windSpeed: parse from Wind info string, normalize to MPS
      windDirection: parse from Wind into string
      windGust: parse from Wind info string, can be null
    }```
  - Push object to allRecords array (Not strictly needed for this task, but now that the data's nicely organized we may as well keep it for potential future use)
  - Check against an array of unique airports. If this airport code is not in that array, push a new object to it:
    ```{
      icaoCode: airport code string
      latestWindSpeed: parsed windspeed from record object above
      latestWindGust: from record object above
      latestWindDirection: from record object above
      latestTimestamp day/hour/minute: parsed time data from record object above
      averageWindSpeed: same as latestWindSpeed, since there's only one record
      sumWindspeed: same as latestWinsSpeed, since there's only one record
      totalReports: 1, since there's only one record
    }```
  - If the airport code IS in the uniques array, replace that record with this one:
    ```{
      icaoCode: airport code string
      latestWindSpeed: parsed windspeed from record object above IF new timestamp is more recent than latestTimestamp
      latestWindGust: windGust from record object above IF new timestamp is more recent than latestTimestamp
      latestWindDirection: windDirection from record object above IF new timestamp is more recent than latestTimestamp
      latestTimestamp day/hour/minute: parsed time data from record object above IF new timestamp is more recent than latestTimestamp
      averageWindSpeed: sumWindspeed  / totalReports
      sumWindspeed: sumWindspeed + latestWinsSpeed
      totalReports: totalReports ++
    }```
- Draw our display: 
  - Show total number of reports (allRecords.length)
  - For each record in unique airports array, display:
    Airport Code: latestWindSpeed (gusting to latestWindGust, if applicable) from latestWindDirection, as of latestTimestamp
    averageWindSpeed this month - number of reports: totalReports
